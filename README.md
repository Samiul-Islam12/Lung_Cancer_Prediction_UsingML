# Lung_Cancer_Prediction_UsingML
This lung cancer prediction model leverages ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and more to classify cancer risk based on factors like age, smoking, and symptoms (coughing, chest pain). It aims to improve early detection using lifestyle and clinical data.
